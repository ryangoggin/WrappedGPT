# Wrapped GPT

Wrapped GPT is a full stack app made with a JS (React and Redux) frontend and Python (Flask and SQLAlchemy) backend. This web app uses Spotify's API in conjunction with Open AI's API to give users more control of their Spotify Wrapped before it is released at the end of the year. Users can see their top artists and songs at that current moment, generate similar artists and songs to their top artists and songs for more music variety, and generate artists and songs to try and get a certain Music Listening Personality.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Your React App will live here.  You will need to run `npm install` to install all your dependencies before starting up the application. While in development, run this application from this location using `npm start`.

No environment variables are needed to run this application in development, but be sure to set the REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable when you deploy!

This app will be automatically built when you push to your main branch on Github.
